## ‚öôÔ∏è Triggers & Functions

### `update_game_options_count()`
Automatically updates `games.total_options_count` whenever a game gets a new launch option or one is removed (via the `game_launch_options` table).

- Triggered on **INSERT/DELETE** in `game_launch_options`.

---

### `update_modified_column()`
Updates the `updated_at` timestamp **before any row is updated** in:

- `games`
- `launch_options`
- (optional: `game_launch_options`)

---

## üîê Security: Row Level Security (RLS)

To protect user data and restrict unauthorized access:

- **RLS is enabled** on all public tables.
- **Authenticated users** can:
  - Insert, update, and delete records (per policy).
  - Read data if permitted.
- Supabase/PostgREST uses these policies to enforce access control.

---

## üíí The Junction Table Ties the Room Together

- ‚úÖ **Normalization**: Avoids data duplication.
- ‚úÖ **Foreign Keys**: Ensures referential integrity.
- ‚úÖ **Junction Table**: Models many-to-many relationships.
- ‚úÖ **Triggers**: Keeps counts and timestamps accurate.
- ‚úÖ **Security**: Hardened functions and RLS enforcement.
