Built with vanilla JavaScript on top of a Supabase-powered postgreSQL database,
allows users to search, sort, and filter launch options for thousands of Steam games. 

This project's core philosophy is to recreate some functionality that modern frameworks abstract away, 
while staying lightweight, fast, and useful. Let's see how it goes :fearful:

## 🛠️ Building Blocks
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node (Express)
- **Database:** Supabase

### 🔄 **Roadmap** 
🚧 **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** – Generate and serve HTML dynamically  
🚧 **Code Splitting & Bundling** – Manually optimize JavaScript loading  
🚧 **Pagination & Infinite Scroll** – Optimize large data sets  
🚧 **Caching Strategies** – Reduce API calls for faster page loads  
🚧 **Scheduled Data Updates** – CRON job to purge stale data and keep game launch options up to date
